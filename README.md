"Patch_attributes" contains plot-level data from vegetation patches across Iberian coastal dunes. "DunePlant_Traits" includes functional traits for 14 dune species, covering morphology, biomass allocation, and plant height, used to assess trait–elevation relationships.

In this repository, you will find a database of vegetation patches sampled along the Iberian coastal dune systems - including Santander, Cádiz, Ebro Delta, and along the catalan coast - as well as functional trait data for 14 characteristic dune plant species, used to explore trait–environment relationships across an elevation gradient.

This database is available in CSV format and includes field-collected data. All spatial information was recorded in situ using a differential GPS (DGPS), ensuring high positional accuracy. Functional trait data for each of the 14 dune plant species were also obtained through direct field sampling, with subsequent measurements conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.

Patch_attributes The information is complemented with the following data: patch attributes - patch width (cm), length (cm), obtaining the patch area (m2), and canopy (cm)-, along with elevation (cm), species richness (number of species), identity of the dominant species, distance of the vegetation patch to the coastline, and thehabitat type (classified between strandline, pioneer dune, dune, and back dune). This file includes metadata such as dune system type (system), classified as wide or narrow/confined depending on sand dune environment and whether each patch is located within an EU-designated Habitat of Community Interest (HIC), supporting ecological assessments in protected coastal environments.

DunePlant_Traits file provides species-level data on dune plants, including taxonomic information (e.g., family, phenology), morphology (e.g., Leaf_form, Form_living, MaximumLeafLength), root and shoot architecture (e.g., RootBiomass_g_m2, TotalRootLength_cm_m2, ShootDensity_m2), biomass allocation (AbovegroundBiomass_g_m2, BelowgroundBiomass_g_m2, RootPF:PS), and physiological traits (e.g., RelativeHumidity, RootsHr, StemHr), based on field and lab measurements.

Contains the R reproducible code to run all the analyses carried out in the study.
